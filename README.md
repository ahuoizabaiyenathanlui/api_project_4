## Countries of the World By Language

The Countries of the World app enables the user to view where in the world the top 10 most widely spoken languages are spoken.

The app was built with jQuery and dynamically interacts with the REST Countries API found at https://restcountries.eu/.

It was developed by Ahuoiza Baiye and Nathan Lui.

# Under development
- upon selection of language, relevant countries should light up on the map
- change background design
